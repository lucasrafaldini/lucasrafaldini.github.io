There is an increased reliance on developers to not only adapt to new technologies but create and improve them.
Developers are the ones who actually make the future happen. They create the software that we use every day, they engine our infrastructure, and they design our devices.

Technology is a powerful force and it is important to recognize the ethical issues that come with it. Developers are in a position of power as they are the ones who create the technology that shapes our lives. It would be wrong for the developers to not fully understand how their work will be implemented and what it will mean for society.
Developers should take responsibility for their creations and make sure they are creating products with positive impacts on society. They should also provide transparency about how their product works, so people can have a say in how it develops over time, or even just decide if they want to use it at all.
