<h1>Questions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Here's a repository of questions I recurrently have to save to think about later because they are too complex or
	they need a more sophisticated answer. If you got here by chance, be welcome and feel free to ask something yourself.

	I am compromised to answer things as long as I understand them. For the parts or the entire matter I am uncapable of
	explaining, I promise to provide some extra sources that will help you get the knowledge you are searching for.

<a href="/questions/2/"> #2 - What are the forms of meditation that were teach by Buda? How can I practice insight meditation?</a>
