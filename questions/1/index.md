## Why is Linux better than Windows or OSx?

In case you don't know, Linux is a type of operating system, which is the software that controls a computer's hardware and allows other programs to run on the computer. Using Linux is often considered to be better than using Windows or OSx (Mac's operating system) for several reasons, but I will only number some of them out:

First, Linux is generally more stable and secure than Windows or OSx. It is less susceptible to viruses and other types of malware, and it is also less likely to crash or become unstable. This makes it a good choice for users who want to protect their personal information and ensure that their computer is always running smoothly.

Second, Linux is often more customizable than Windows or OSx. Users can easily modify and tweak the operating system to suit their specific needs, and they have a lot of control over how the system behaves. This makes it a good choice for users who want to be able to customize their computer to their liking.

Third, Linux is often free or inexpensive to use. Many versions of the operating system are open source, which means that anyone can download and use them for free. This makes it a good choice for users who want to save money on their operating system.

Overall, Linux is a powerful and versatile operating system that offers many advantages over using a personal computer with a Windows or OSx operating system. It is stable, secure, customizable, and often free to use, which makes it a good choice for many different types of users.
